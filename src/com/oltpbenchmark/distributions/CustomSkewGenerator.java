 * This random number generator generates a custom skew with according to two parameters, data skew and access skew. Data skew represents what percentage of

 * example, an 80/20 skew means that 80% of the numbers will be generated from 20% of the total range of values. In this implementation, the hot range
 * is the range [0, data skew ceiling], i.e. the lower end of the range.
